<h1>A hope document</h1>
<p>This is a demo to show and test the experimental Hope API</p>
<p>Hope is a web based platform for interoperable documents that render themselves and can communicate among themselves</p>
<p>Because each document is also a running (javascript) application, I've called them 'doclets'.</p>
<p>The major innovation is that doclets can be hosted anywhere. Because they use the postMessage API, they can communicate cross domain. You can embed 'untrusted' doclets, since they can <em>only</em> interact using the postMessage API.</p>
<p>Below is a basic log doclet</p>

<iframe name="log" src="log.html"></iframe>
<script type="module">
    import { hope } from "/a-new-hope/js/hope.js"   

    hope.bus.debug = true;

    let doclet = document.hope.doclets.log;

    doclet.connect()
    .then(() => {
    	let log = doclet.api('/x/log/');
    	log.write({message:'Hello world'})
    	.catch(e => {
	    	console.log('timeout');
	    });
    });
</script>

<p>Open the console (ctrl-shift-i) to see a log of messages from the host
bus</p>
<p>Some calls to try:</p>
<pre>
  let api = document.hope.doclets.log.api('/x/log/');
  api.write({message:'Another line'});
</pre>
<p>This writes a new log line and should grow the log doclet.</p>
<pre>  
  let reflect = document.hope.doclets.log.api('/x/hope/reflect/');
  reflect.list().then(m => { console.log(m) });
  reflect.get({ api: '/x/log/'}).then(m => { console.log(m) });
</pre>
<p>This first lists a number of supported API's in a doclet. Then it shows details about the '/x/log/' API.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seamless iframes probably should default to use the full width, even if not
needed by the doclet. This prevents weird resizing.</li>
<li>It would be even better to make a shadow version with no size boundaries
and test the size there... however this is not trivial</li>
<li>Bug: the reply from a call from a doclet to the host is sent to the
host... instead of the doclet.</li>
</ul>
